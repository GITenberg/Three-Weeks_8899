description: English aristocrat Paul Verdayne is sent to Lucerne to break up his unsuitable
  love affair with the parson's daughter. The Lady is a Balkan queen on the run from
  her cruel husband. And so begins their passionate three-week affair, which ends
  only when the Lady leaves to return to her country. A sensation when first published
  in 1907, Three Weeks was remarkable for its overt theme of adultery and abundant
  depictions of its characters' kisses and caresses, and sold over five million copies
  to scandalized readers. Three Weeks was later made into a silent film starring Aileen
  Pringle and Conrad Nagel. HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature
  to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and
  celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the HarperPerennial
  Classics collection to build your digital library.
